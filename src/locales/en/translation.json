    "desc": "My name is Natalia Baranova. I am a full-stack developer seeking opportunities for professional growth. I worked with databases at the Ministry of Economic Development for over 10 years and developed my own solution using MS Access. Later, I transitioned to web development and worked with PHP using frameworks like Laravel, Yii2, and Symfony 5. After that, I decided to expand my knowledge and try my hand at frontend development. For this, I attended an IT school where I studied JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Next.js. Although working on the frontend gave me valuable experience, I realized that I enjoy backend development the most. Currently, I am actively improving my skills in this area by working with Laravel/PHP in a startup team."
